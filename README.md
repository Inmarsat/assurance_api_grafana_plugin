# assurance_api_grafana_plugin
A python script which acts as a bridge between Grafana and the Inmarsat Assurance API. 

To enable Grafana to gather data from the Inmarsat REST APIs, a bridge is needed. The Simple JSON data source in Grafana coupled with a Flask webserver, is provided as an example bridge. The Flask webserver exposes endpoints which query the Inmarsat API and return assurance data a specified JSON format. The Simple JSON data source then queries the Flask webserverâ€™s endpoints, and feeds the data into Grafana.

This is an example of a dashboard which can be created using the plugin:



*Documentation word document* contains more information and installation instructions.
*Grafana json file* contains an example dashboard, in JSON format.
*flask_bridge.py* is the python code.
*dashboard_image.jpg* is an image of an example dashboard.
